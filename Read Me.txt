Version Differences

Ver. 1.1
-There was a normal sandy blooper enemy who would take you to the
Super Blooper battle.  This blooper now has normal blooper enemies
to fight, as was intended.
-Mage Armor now defends against the stats it's supposed to.
-Fixed an issue with Green's "Trident" weapon where if the enemy
target was too far away the bat would not disappear properly.
Stacking too many bats on screen could cause the game to crash.
-Minor tweaks to a handful of enemy stats to better balance them.

Here's some basic info in FAQ form
**********************************
Q. What is this?
A. This is a mod (or "Romhack" as they're sometimes called) of Super
Mario RPG.

Q. What does this mod change?
A. Short Answer: A lot.
Long Answer:
-The five playable characters have been replaced by the Koopa Bros.
and a reluctant fifth member.
-New levels.
-New events and scripts.
-New story and dialogues.
-Custom sprites, including allies, enemies, and weapons.
-Custom animations.
-New items and equipment.
-Collectibles and extras.
-Enemies are the same in appearance only.  Their stats, attack
patterns, strengths & weaknesses, etc. are all changed.

Q. How do I play it?
A. You must apply this .ips patch to a clean ROM of the US version of
Super Mario RPG.  I cannot provide you this ROM.
There are tools to help apply .ips patches.  I suggest you use your
favorite search engine to find information about them.

Q. How long is it?
A. Comparable in length to the original SMRPG.  Maybe even longer
due to increased difficulty.

Q. What's the difficulty like?
A. In general, it's more difficult than the original.  Understanding
things like elemental strengths and weaknesses, blocking and using
status effects, and playing to each individual character's strengths
are much more important in this game.
The difficulty curve is broken down into two parts:
-Main Game: It's more difficult than the original, but as long as
you keep up to date with equipment, don't avoid every enemy you see,
and are decent with your attack and defense timings, you shouldn't
have to do any grinding.  Even if you choose the "worst" stat
upgrades each level up, the game is still very much beatable.
-Optional Content: Most optional battles will be fairly difficult if
you attempt them as soon as they are available.  These battles
will be a fun challenge to those who want to sweat a little bit, but
don't be afraid to come back after a few level ups if you can't beat
something right away.  Endgame optional content will really test you.
Even at the max level with optimal equipment, several heavy
hitting foes will be quite a challenge.

Q. What is the max level?
A. 30.  However, it's important to note that you still gain
substantial stat boosts through level 25 as opposed to level 20 in
the original game.

Q. What level do I need to be to beat the game?
A. You can probably beat the game around level 20-21, but if you want
to take on all the optional endgame content, you'll want to be at
least level 25.

Q. How was this made?
A. 99.9% using the Lazy Shell Editor ver 3.19.  The rest was done
using a hex editor.

Q. What secrets and extras are there?
A. There are enough flowers to get exactly 99 FP.  
-CAUTION: when fighting bosses, I suggest leaving at least one open
slot in your inventory for whatever they may drop.  If the boss is
supposed to drop a Flower Tab but you have a full inventory, they
won't drop it.  This means you won't be able to hit 99 FP on that
save file.
-There are also only enough frog coins to buy all of the frog
disciple's items.
-There is plenty of other optional content including battles, an
optional secret level, and more.  I don't want to spoil everything
for you!

Q. Are there any game breaking bugs/crashes I should know about?
A. None that I've encountered.  There may be some miscellaneous
errors (like Red is visible behind a small patch of wall, etc.) but
nothing game breaking.

Q. I found a game breaking error!
A. Please report it to me.  I can't guarantee I'll fix everything,
but I'll certainly fix what I can.

Q. There's an empty slot in my Special Items menu.  What did I miss?
A. Nothing.  It turns out you can't have more than 15 items in your
special item inventory.  If you receive another special item, it will
take you to the Discard Items menu.  I'm sorry you have to look at
that annoying, empty spot.

Some of you might be familiar with my "Legend of the Axem Rangers"
mod.  In my humble opinion, this mod completely surpasses that one
in terms of scope and polish.
If you like SMRPG, it might still be worth a try.
