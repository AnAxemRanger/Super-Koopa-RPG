walkthrough, and information about various side content.
Both sections contain spoilers so read at your own risk.

Outlined Walkthrough
*********************************************************************
This is intended to be a very brief walkthrough of the game.  I will
not be telling you to open chests, what strategies to use against 
which enemies, to buy items or equipment, etc. This guide serves
only to tell you where to go if you've gotten lost or forgot what you
were doing.

=====
Start
=====
-As soon as you get control of Green-
Head to the vault.  It's in the Southeast (bottom right) part of the
castle.
Once you get the crystal, head to the throne room (center of the
castle).
-Watch the scene.  Control shifts to Red-

=============
Bowser's Keep
=============
Go through the door at the top right.  Keep going through these rooms
until you talk to Kamek.
-Watch the scene with Black and Kooper-
Once you're back in control of Red, leave the Keep.  Take the
shorcut through the statue at the far end of the hall.

================
Valley of Bowser
================
This area is linear so it's hard to get lost.  You will have to do
some platforming in one room.  Fight the boss and move on.

================
Mushroom Kingdom
================
Talk to the Chancellor to have him open up the east gate.  Go through
that gate and back out to the world map.

============
Winter Woods
============
To find your way to the end and get to Goomstar Temple:
-From the start, go straight ahead to the next area.
-Go down the tree trunk.
-hop on the trampoline at the far side of this undeground area.
-Go down the tree trunk that's furthest toward the northeast (top
	right) side of the screen.
-Go down the hole.
-Head through the only exit in this room that isn't a trampoline.

===============
Goomstar Temple
===============
From the entrance, take a right and follow this route all the way
until you fight the Goomba statues.
After, come back to the entrance and Red will automatically place
a goomba statue on a pedastal to open the big door.
Head on through this door, get Black on your team, and continue on
until you reach the end and fight Alli.
Afterwards, you'll be taken back to Bowser's Keep to watch a
cutscene.  Once you're back in control, head out to the world map.

=============
Koopa Village
=============
Go to the first house in the second area and talk to the Koopa
inside.  Then, head back out to the world map.

==============
Booster Fields
==============
In the first area, take a left.  You'll see scenes of a plant
chasing a snifit in multiple areas.  Once you get to the deadend
area, you must intercept the plant chasing the snifit.  The snifit
will run through you, so don't be afraid to stand right where he's
running.
After the battle, the snifit will run away.  Go back to the first
area and take a right this time.  Help the snifit by fighting the
plant here.
After, go back to the first area and head into the house.

=======================
Booster Fields - Office
=======================
Go down the stairs and keep heading that way.  Down the big 
staircase, across the platforms, and to the end.  Chase down the
snifit to get the key.  Now head back up to the first room, open the
door, and head on through to fight Booster.
After, head back to Koopa Village and report to the Elder.
Next, report back to Kamek in Bowser's Keep.
After that, go to the world map and head to Kalamari Desert.

===============
Kalamari Desert
===============
From the first area, head right (southeast), then up (northeast).
You'll fight the Super blooper.
After, head back to the first room.  From the entrance to the desert:
-Head straight (northeast exit)
-straight (northeast exit)
-straight (northeast exit)
-straight (northeast exit) once again
-left (northwest exit)
-right (northeast exit)
You'll find yourself in Kalamari Outpost.  Head to the house in the
back to talk to the bob-elder.  Next, hop up the cliffs at the back
of the area and jump in the hole.
Once you're in the clouds, just hop on the vines and climb up until
you can't go up anymore.

==========
Glitzville
==========
Head through the doors up the staircase.
Once inside, you'll watch a couple of scenes.  After a battle against
the goombas, you'll be inside a locker room.  To continue, talk to
the doll on the table and schedule a match.  You'll be sent to the
Glitz Pit to battle.  Upon victory, you'll end up back in the locker
room.  Repeat the process of talking to the doll to schedule matches
and winning fights until Toadofsky talks to you in his office.

At this point, you need to go in the major league locker room.  From
the manager's office, go down the hallway southeast and enter the
first path you see.  You'll know it's the right one because the
guards won't stop you.  Again, follow the pattern of scheduling
matches and winning fights.

After defeating the big bombs, you'll be met with a cutscene.  After,
it's back to scheduling and winning matches.

Once you've beaten the ant, you'll find another cutscene.  From here,
go to the manager's room (where you talked to Toadofsky before).  You
will find a key.  Take this key and open the room right next door.
Climb up the stairs for your next boss fight.

After the fight, go back to the locker room to schedule your final
match.

Defeat the champ and you'll be greeted with a few more cutscenes
which end with you in control of Kooper.

===============
Shadoo's Castle
===============
As Kooper, defeat the guards.  One well timed Deep Freeze should to
it.  After battle, it should be pretty easy to find where you're
going since there's only one pathway that isn't locked.

Once you're back in control of Red, head to the world map and go to
the newly opened Booster Gorge.

=============
Booster Gorge
=============
You have three options to proceed:
-Go across the bridge by paying 100 coins to Ball Dude.
-Defeat Ball Dude in battle to cross the bridge.  Unless you're
overleveled, you'll probably lose.
-Go down and around the gorge to get to the other side.  Head to the
southern end of the area to hop down the cliffs.  Keep hopping down
and going south for a few screens until you hit the lake.  You'll
have to jump across the yellow platforms to get to the other side.
The other side of the lake is a mirror image of the first side.  Hop
up the cliffs to get to the other side.  Once you've reached the
other side of the bridge from the first area, head to the exit on the
right which will lead you back to the world map.  Head to the map
point past the Gorge.

==========
Dire Docks
==========
Head on down to the docks south of the area.  Investigate the empty 
treasure chest toward the end.  Once you do, you'll be kidnapped by a
crane and taken into the cargo hold.

============
Shyrate Ship
============
The pathway to the end is linear, so just fight your way on through.
After a fight with Captain General Guy, you'll end up on...

============
Shobo Island
============
Head into the base.  Talking to General Guy is optional.  Head down
the stairs to the bottom level.  Hop into the sink to end up in the
sewers.

The sewers are linear so just platform your way to the other side and
go down the pipe to get to the bob-ombs base.

Once inside the base, head up the stairs until you come to a room
with multiple exits and some bob-ombs roaming around.  Take both the
left and right paths and fight the bombs in them.  Once you have
their key cards, use them to climb the stairs and pass the robot
guarding the next set of stairs.  Fight the boss at the top.
Afterward, you'll be met with a couple of scenes and in control of
Kooper.

==========
Underwhere
==========
It should be simple enough to find your way.  There's only one path
where you won't be stopped.  Head to the Underkeeper's area for a
series of cutscenes.

Once you're back in control of the whole gang, head back to the
Underkeeper's area.  After some talking, go through the doorway on
the left side.  Once inside, take either the right path or the left
path.  You have to do both either way.

For the left path, you'll have to hop on the moving platform and jump
to avoid the bullet bills.  In the 2nd room, hop up to the top and go
through the door.  The game will ask you which of the two statues in
this room match the statue at the entrance to the dungeon.  The
answer is the left one.

For the right path, you'll have to jump on the cannonball and ride it
to the other side of the room, battle a series of enemies, and then
answer the quiz questions.

Once you've done both the left and right paths, the path in the
middle of the dungeon's entrance will open.  Take it and fight the
boss.  After, you'll see a few expositional cutscenes.

Once you're back in control of Red in Bowser's Keep, head out to the
world map and back to Dire Docks.

==========
Dire Docks
==========
Talk to the shy guy hanging out on the dock and he'll let you board
their ship.  Head on board when you're ready.

===================
Sunken Shyrate Ship
===================
Head out the door into the watery hallway.  From here, head straight
to the other side.  In the room with the chest, head straight across
to the northeast door.
In the big underwater room, climb up the stack of barrels to the
ledge and go through the door.  The caves portion of this level is
windy and turny, but there's only one way to go.  Go all the way
through until you fight the boss.
After the fight, jump in to the hole with the whirlpool.

==============
Yoshi's Island
==============
After your arrival and a short cutscene, head straight ahead to the
next area.  In this big area, head into the hut at the northwest end
of the area to talk to the chief.  After you do, go back to the big
area and head northeast and go through the exit.
Walk your way around, up, and down the temple until you get to the
next area.  In here, you'll have a boss fight.
After the boss fight, head back to the chief and talk to him.
After another few scenes, you'll be teleported to the world map.
A new map point has opened up next to Dire Docks.

==============
Cocoa Mountain
==============
This place is pretty maze-like.  Here's how to proceed forward:
-From the first room, there's only one other path: hop up the rocks.
-In the next area, climb up the rocks and take the top exit.
-In the third area, again climb up the rocks and take the top exit.
-Next, go inside the cave.
-Inside the cave, take the top path to the other side of the room.
-Take the southwest exit.
-You should now be in an outdoor area with 4 cave entrances.  Take
	the top right one.
-In this area, take the exit on the right.
-Hop up on the crates and take the exit.
-You'll come to a room with a save point.  There's only one way
	forward from here.  Keep going until you hit the village.

==========
Cocoa Town
==========
Head past all the houses to get to the mine.  Once inside, there are
only a couple of screens with only 1 other exit.  In the second room,
head to the doorway that's blocked by rubble to initiate a boss
battle.
After that, head into the newly opened doorway into another boss
fight.
Next, you'll watch some scenes and end up back in Bowser's Keep.  Go
out to the world map and head to the newest point that has opened
up: Spooky Valley.

=============
Spooky Valley
=============
The path is winding, but each area has only one way to go besides the
way you came in.  It shouldn't be hard to find your way to the Ghost
House.  You will have a boss fight before you get there though.

===========
Ghost House
===========
To beat this level, you must defeat four enemies located within four
treasure chests.  
For each of these, start out in the first room:
-Go straight ahead through the door.  You should be in an outdoor
area.  Go straight through the next door.  In this room, take a
right.  Defeat the enemy in the treasure chest.
-Take a right and go through that exit.  In the next room, take a
left through the door.  Open the treasure chest by the sink and
defeat the enemy.
-Take a left and go up the stairs.  Head through the only door in
this room.  Press A to examine the window and choose to head through
it.  Go through the exit on the other side of this area.  You should
be in a room with five chests.  The enemy you need to fight is in the
middle chest.  Simply walk over to the window to leave.
-Go straight ahead through the door.  You should be in an outdoor
area.  Jump up the stacks of boxes and press A to examine the window.
Head through the window.  Once inside, there's only one path to the
chest.  Keep going until you reach the deadend with the chest.

After beating all four treasure chest enemies, head back to the first
room.  Along the back wall, take the door on the left.  You should
see all four candles lit and a boss battle will start automatically.
After the boss, head through the door in front of you for another
boss battle.
You'll see a couple of scenes and end up back in Bowser's Keep.

=============
Bowser's Keep
=============
It's time to head to the sewers.  From the entrance to Bowser's Keep,
go through the passage on the right (southeast).  In this room,
continue straight (again, southeast).  In the room with the hammer
bro and the goomba, when you get to the fork take the door on the
right side.  You should be in a small room with a single pipe.  Go
down the pipe.

======
Sewers
======
In the first room of the sewers, you'll see three possible directions
to go.  Take the middle path by going down the stairs.
In this room, make your way down to the bottommost level and take the
exit.
In the watery room, you'll have to swim to the other side, hop up on
the ledge.  At the top end of the room, you'll have to navigate the
bees by either jumping over and around them or fighting them.  Either
way, make your way to the exit leading northeast.
Press A to examine the thwomp statue in front of you.  As long as
you've beaten the Ghost House level, this statue should disappear.
Swim to the other side of the room and jump on the pipe to initiate
a boss fight.  Afterwards, go down the pipe to end up in...

===============
Shadoo's Castle
===============
You made it to the last level.  Go straight through the castle doors.
The first room of the castle has a whopping eight directions to
choose from.  Two of them are currently locked, and one of them has a
trampoline that opens up a shortcut to Mario's Pad.  To proceed
forward, you need to go through the other five passages.  Each of
these pathways will have you fight a 1 vs 1 battle between each of
the five playable characters and their clone.  Once you've beaten all
five, the door at the top of the big room opens.  Go through it.

Head up the stairs and into the next room.  In here, you'll have a
boss fight.  Once that's done, continue on and head up the stairs in
the next room.  In the hallway with several exits, your goal is to go
through the one on the far side directly ahead of where you entered.
However, it's locked.  Of the three exits along the back wall, go
through the rightmost one.  In this room press A to examine the 5th
picture in line.  This will unlock the path at the end of the
hallway.  Head back and go through it.

In this room, your goal is to go through the door at the top of the
stairs, but it's locked.  Of the two open doors, go through the one
on the right first.  Take a mental note (or a physical note) of the
location of the switch.  Go back out of this room and go through the
left door now.  Your goal is to push this small yoshi statue on to
the same spot that the swtich is on in the other room.  If you press
A while next to the little yoshi statue, it will move one tile in the
direction you were facing when you pressed A.  If you get it stuck
against the wall, you can exit the room and come back in to reset it.
Once you've got it in the right spot, you'll hear the switch get
pressed and receive a textbox telling you something opened up.  Now
you can go through the door at the top of the stairs.

Head through this hallway into the next room.  Here, you'll get into
another boss fight.  After the fight, you'll get a message telling
you that something has been unlocked downstairs.  Go all the way down
to the big room with 8 different paths.  The door next to the stairs
has now been opened.  Head on through.

In this room you'll see several staircases.  Keep on going down them.
In the next room, again, head down the staircases.  You'll see a very
short staircase at the bottom of the room.  Go down that to get to
the next room.  From here, go through the only other exit to get to
the next room.  

In this room, you'll find a boss fight.  Once that's over, keep going
to the only other exit in this room.  In this room, head down the big
staircase and go through the exit past the save point to fight the
final boss.

Congrats!  You made it to the end!




*********************************************************************
Secrets and Extras
*********************************************************************
Read on only if you want the various side content of this game to be
spoiled for you.  You have been warned.

===========
Cumulo Keep
===========
This is a secret level accessed through Glitzville.  In the main
outside area of Glitzville, you can fall through the sky on the right
side of the bar by walking off the edge.
-To do much of anything here, you need the Cumulo Seal.  This is
obtained by defeating Ball Dude (the Booster Gorge toll bridge guy).
In addition to some flowers and items in chests, there is a treasure
chest with infinite coins and a guy name Blade Dude who sells the
best character-unique armor in the game.

======
Sewers
======
You must pass through the sewers to get to the last level, but the
sewers themselves are open from the start of the game.  Enemies here
will be very difficult, but there is some good stuff to find.
Features include:
-Lucky Hammer.  Functions identically to the original game.
-Flowers, Frog Coins, and items.
-Shop that sells attack battle items.
-Flag Finding Game, which is how you get the Lazy Shell armor.
-Shortcuts to some of the harder to reach spots of various levels, as
long as you've beaten that area already.

=========
Star Road
=========
The Star Road appears on the world map after you've found all five
star flowers that open the way.
This area features some of the toughest normal fights in the game.
It's a good area for grinding late game if you're looking to take on
all the optional content.
Your reward for finding it is the Star Amulet which boosts all of
your stats in battle, similar to the Quartz Charm from the original.
Booster will give you clues to the locations of these flowers if you
answer his hunt request, but if you're reading this file you probably
don't care about finding these the "intended" way.
Star Flower locations:
-Soda Lake (Booster Gorge): hop on the extra platform that's off to
	the side of the others.
-Cocoa Mountain: in the deadend room, jump to hit the hidden switch
	located under the awning.  This makes a platform appear which
	you can use to get to the next area.  Keep going until you
	get to the room with the trampoline and jump on it.
-Winter Woods Underground: There's a circular area with two
	trampolines and a handful of blue geckos.  Jump into the
	corner obscured by the wall to find a hidden trampoline.
-Sunken Ship: Find the hidden room underwater.  It's the same room
	that has the Safety Ring in the original game.
-Ghost House: From the entrance, take the stairs to the left.  In
	this room, press A to examine the table.

=================
Flag Finding Game
=================
Talk to the Heavy Troopa in the sewers and he'll ask you to play this
game.  He's hidden three invisible flags somewhere in the world.  If
you can find them, he'll reward you with the Lazy Shell armor.  Just
like the original game with the Ghost Medal, you have to press A on
the spot you think the flag is located.
Flag Locations:
-The first flower bush you see upon entering the Mushroom Kingdom.
-One of the blue flowers on the north side of the river in Booster
Gorge.
-The bookshelf above the small mole girl's head in the Cocoa Town
item shop.

===================================
The Underwhere's Otherworldy Prison
===================================
Through the passage behind the Underkeeper (not the passage that
takes you to the inner sanctum), there are six doors which contain
tough boss fights.  The reward for these fights is each character's
ultimate weapon and a good piece of armor anyone can use.

Once you beat them, you can challenge the Underkeeper himself!  If
you beat him, he'll give you a great piece of armor anyone can use.

====================
Glitz Pit After Dark
====================
A hidden area of the Glitz Pit which features some of the toughest
foes this game has to offer.  To access it, you must have beaten
the champion of the Glitz Pit and defeated the boss of the Bob-omb's
base on Shobo Island.  Once you have, talk to the Bob-omb in
Glitzville who is in the arena viewing area.  He'll give you the key
to the shower in the champ's room.
Finding it is one thing but defeating the enemies here is another.
Good luck!
You get the Star Egg for beating all of them.  But if you can beat
all of them, you probably won't need it.

==============
Hunter's Guild
==============
Koopregard, a terrapin in Bowser's Keep, runs this.
There are 25 total hunts to do, including the final one given to you
by Koopregard himself.  You get a lot of stuff from beating hunts,
including flowers, frog coins, items, and unique equipment.
Hunts are unlocked in one of two ways:
-Progress through the story of the game.
-Complete hunts that are available to you.

The Winter Plant hunt enemy can be a bit hard to find.  In Winter
Woods, you'll find a long room with three tree trunks in it.  It pops
in and out of the topmost trunk.  You have to jump on and around the
trunk for him to appear.  He tends not to appear if the gecko in the
same room is chasing you.  If he's not appearing, I suggest exiting
through the only non-tree trunk exit and coming back.

==============
Kooper's House
==============
Once Kooper joins your team, you will have access to his house in
Koopa Village.  There isn't much here at first, but as you meet
certain milestones, trophies will be added.
Trophies:
-Black enemy from treasure chests: defeat all Otherwordly Prison foes
-Mini Axem Red: defeat all Glitz Pit After Dark foes
-Star: finish the Star Road and watch its cutscene
-Terrapin Armor: Defeat the final Hunter's Guild hunt
-Frog Coin: Own all items sold by the Frog Coin shop
-Crystal: Defeat Shadoo's first battle
-Paratroopa Shell: Complete the Flag Finding game

=============
Miscellaneous
=============
-The temple on Yoshi's Island features an invisible path.  When
coming down the big flight of stairs, hug the southeastern wall.
There is an NPC here who sells battle items.  You must have the
"Shady Pass" for him to sell things to you.
-The "Shady Pass" is located in Booster Gorge.  There is an NPC
hidden behind the northern hut who sells it to you for 300 coins.
-There are some items that are harder to find than others that you
need for a couple different things:
	-Koopa Leaf: sold in Koopa Village.
	-Sand Fruit: dropped by Desert Lotus enemies in Kalamari Desert.
	-Cocoa Rock: dropped by Mouserider enemies in Cocoa Mountain/mine.

=======
Flowers
=======
There are enough flowers to get exactly 99 FP.  
CAUTION: when fighting bosses, I suggest leaving at least one open
slot in your inventory for whatever they may drop.  If the boss is
supposed to drop a Flower Tab but you have a full inventory, they
won't drop it.  This means you won't be able to hit 99 FP on that
save file.
